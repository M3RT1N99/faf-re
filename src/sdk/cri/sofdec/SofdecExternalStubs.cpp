// SofdecExternalStubs.cpp
//
// Linker stubs for Sofdec/CRI middleware symbols.
//
// IMPORTANT: Contrary to the original "external DLL" framing, all 135 of the
// stubbed functions here EXIST IN THE FA BINARY as statically-linked code.
// Sofdec was shipped as object files (.obj) inside ForgedAlliance.exe, not as
// a redistributable DLL. See `decomp/recovery/disasm/fa_full_2026_03_26/` —
// each stubbed name resolves to a `FUN_XXXXXXXX` address with real
// instructions. Total binary code currently replaced by these stubs:
// ~29,876 bytes / ~10,452 x86 instructions.
//
// These stubs exist solely to let the exe LINK while the underlying Sofdec
// recovery remains in progress. They are no-ops that return 0/nullptr and
// will silently suppress all movie playback (SFD/MPV/ADXT/MWSFCRE). Recovery
// targets:
//
//   - Biggest pending: parse_PES_packet_sub (FUN_00AE0F80, 8,869 bytes),
//     cft_c_Ycc420plnToArgb8888Int1smp (FUN_00B03F10, 3,299 bytes),
//     cft_sse_Ycc420plnToArgb8888Int1smp (FUN_00B059E0, 2,259 bytes).
//   - Blocked-by-struct-layout: MPVCMC_*, MPVUMC_*, SFMPVF_GetNumFrm,
//     SFTIM_InitTcode/Ttu, UTY_MemsetDword, mpvcmc_InitMcOiTa,
//     sfmpvf_IsChkFirst/SetPicUsrBuf — bodies exist in
//     cri/sofdec/SofdecMpvRuntime.cpp but that TU has ~25 failing
//     static_asserts on moho::SofdecSfdWorkctrlSubobj + missing helpers
//     (sfmpv_SkipFrm, sfmpv_ConcatSub). See tmp/sofdec_binary_state.tsv
//     for the full prioritized list.
//
// Data stubs are zero-initialized 4 KB buffers; indexed accesses stay
// in-range but yield zeros.
//
// TREAT EVERY DATA STUB BELOW AS SUSPECT. A sweep of these names against
// the PE section map found 28 of them are real initialized .rdata/.data in
// the shipped image — we are silently substituting zeros for live tables,
// which produces subsystems that initialize cleanly and then behave as if
// their content were empty. Two rounds of that were already fixed:
// mpvvlt_run_level_* (the MPEG-1 run/level VLC tables, so every decoder
// lookup returned nothing) and SFD_tr_vd_mpv / SFD_tr_sd_mps /
// SFD_tr_sd_m2ts (transfer-strategy descriptors that existed BOTH here as
// zeros and as populated objects in SofdecSfdRuntime.cpp, with the create
// path binding the zeros).
//
// To classify one: grep the .asm exports for `offset _NAME`, take the
// 4-byte immediate out of the instruction encoding to get its VA, then
// check it against the PE section table — `rva - sectionVA >= rawSize`
// means genuine BSS (a zero stub is correct), otherwise it is initialized
// and the bytes are at `ptr + (rva - sectionVA)`. Size comes from whatever
// copies or walks the table, the way mpvvlc_SetVlcRunLevel gave the
// run/level dword counts.
//
// Still outstanding are the Dolby/MPEG audio tables (dolby_*, sin_*,
// mpadcd_*, alloc_len_*, book, m2adec_*) — that is movie sound. Only 54 of
// these names resolved to addresses via the `offset _NAME` scan; the other
// 71 are referenced some other way and are unclassified.

  // ADXM_WaitVsync (0x00B06E60) parks the caller until the multimedia-timer

  // ADXT_Init (0x00B0A390): real body in
  // cri/sofdec/SofdecAdxPlatformRuntime.cpp. This is the ADX runtime bootstrap
  // and, critically, the registrar for the three ADXT server callbacks. While
  // it was a stub nothing ever registered adxt_exec_fssvr on the FS lane, so
  // adxstm_ExecServer never ran and no ADXSTM slot was ever serviced: movies
  // bound their file, started their stream, and read zero bytes forever.
  // CRIERR_CallErr (0x00B20770): real body in

  // beside M2TSD_Finish and M2TSD_GetVersionStr, the other two members of the
  // same library-lifetime trio.
  // M2T_Create (0x00AE32C0): real body in cri/sofdec/SofdecSfdRuntime.cpp,
  // beside M2T_Destroy. While it was a stub initHn_m2tsd handed every M2TSD
  // handle a null M2T supply address, so the transport-stream layer had
  // nothing to demultiplex into.

  //
  // As no-arg stubs they answered every call with "no error, nothing

  // MWSFCRE_DestroySfd (0x00AC7F40): real body in
  // cri/sofdec/SofdecAdxPlatformRuntime.cpp. As a no-argument stub C linkage
  // let it stand in for the real one-parameter function, so `mwply_Destroy`
  // released a playback handle without ever destroying the SFD work control
  // inside it. Every movie open then leaked one MPS parser handle out of a pool
  // of 32, and the loading screen - which reopens its movie on every loop - ran
  // the pool dry and drew "E2012 mwPlyCreate:can't create SFD" from then on.
  // MWSFCRE_SetSupplySj (0x00AC7D80): real body in
  // cri/sofdec/SofdecAdxPlatformRuntime.cpp. As a no-arg stub it silently
  // satisfied every `MWSFCRE_SetSupplySj(ply)` call, so the SFD's input lane
  // was never bound to the stream SJ ring. `mwsfcre_CalcWorkStmBuf` reports
  // `sib = 0` on purpose, which leaves SFBUF lane 0 "awaiting supply" - this
  // function is what hands it the ring. Without it the demuxer parsed an empty
  // ring on every server tick and no movie ever produced a frame.
  // MWSFD_GetUsePicUsr (0x00AC9350) reads the library's use-picture-user-data
  // lane; recovered in cri/sofdec/SofdecAdxPlatformRuntime.cpp next to the

  // MWSFD_IsEnableHndl (0x00ACBA10) is recovered in SofdecFoundationRuntime.cpp.
  // Its stub took no arguments, so C linkage let it satisfy every
  // MWSFD_IsEnableHndl(ply) call while always answering "not enabled" -- which
  // is why a successfully created playback handle still drew "handle is
  // invalid" from mwPlyGetStat, mwPlySetFrmSync and mwPlyStartFname alike.
  // MWSFD_SetCond (0x00ACB930): real body in SofdecAdxPlatformRuntime.cpp
  // beside MWSFD_GetCond, which it mirrors.

  // cri/sofdec/SofdecAdxPlatformRuntime.cpp, next to MWSFSVR_SetHnSfdSvrFlg.
  // As a no-arg void* stub it silently ate the "server border requested" flag
  // instead of publishing it into the playback handle / library work lane, so

  // MWSFPLY_SetFlowLimit (0x00ACB330) has had a real body in

  // referenced by nothing.
  // MWSFSVM_Error: real body in SofdecSvmTransferRuntime.cpp.
  // MWSFSVM_GotoIdleBorder (0x00ACCD00): real body in
  // cri/sofdec/SofdecSvmTransferRuntime.cpp. A thin `SVM_GotoSvrBorder(6)`
  // wrapper; while it was a stub the decode server never actually parked at
  // its idle border, so mwPlyFinishSfdFx/mwlSfdSleepDecSvr's teardown/sleep
  // dance was a no-op.

  // frame was ever decoded.
  // MWSFSVR_CheckForceSvrBdr (0x00AD91C0) and mwsfsvr_ExecForceSvrBdr
  // (0x00AD91E0): real bodies in SofdecAdxPlatformRuntime.cpp beside

  // MWSFSVR_SetMwsfdSvrFlg (0x00AD9870): real body in
