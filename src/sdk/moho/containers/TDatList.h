  /**
   * Intrusive list node (prev/next only). No payload.
   * T is the *declared* owner type for RTTI/signatures; layout is two pointers.
   *
   * @warning These two names are inverted with respect to the binary. Slot
   * `+0x00` is the **next** pointer and `+0x04` is the **prev** pointer, so
   * `mPrev` below actually names the next link. Verified from two independent
   * functions:
   *
   *   - `FUN_00632BC0` (an out-of-line `~TDatListItem`) does
   *     `[+0]->[+4] = [+4]` then `[+4]->[+0] = [+0]`, i.e.
   *     `next->prev = prev; prev->next = next`.
   *   - `FUN_007AE2B0` (`Broadcaster<SCameraTracking>::BroadcastEvent`) splices
   *     with `X->[+0]->[+4] = S` and `X->[+4]->[+0] = S`, and tests emptiness
   *     on `[+4]`.
   *
   * `moho::CameraTrackingBroadcasterLink` in
   * `moho/render/camera/CameraTrackingListener.h` names the same two slots the
   * other way round -- `{mListNext @ +0x00, mListPrev @ +0x04}` -- and is the
   * one that matches the binary.
   *
   * This is **not** a live bug and must not be "fixed" casually. A doubly
   * linked list is symmetric under swapping the two names, and every use here
   * is internally consistent: `ListUnlinkSelf`'s
   * `mPrev->mNext = mNext; mNext->mPrev = mPrev;` emits exactly the binary's
   * two stores. Renaming would touch nearly the whole engine for no
   * behavioural gain, and a half-applied swap would be catastrophic.
   *
   * What it does forbid: mixing the two views on one list, and converting a
   * raw `object + 0x04` sub-object pointer into a `TDatListItem*`/`Broadcaster*`
   * and then using the field names. By slot the two agree; by name they are
   * opposites, so such a "tidy-up" silently swaps prev and next.
